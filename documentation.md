# A Rough Documentation for starters
 
Now the app allows for deleting the goal file itself using the `delete-file` command for cases when the goal file has become corrupted for whatever reason

TODO:
Could add the same for "completed.json" file.
ASK: Should "goals" be referenced as "goalz" at all places? That could be cool!
Wonder: Maybe I should have a journal.md file in every project so that I am able to brain dump my ideas and use them later! YES!
print errors/warnings in different color for visibility.

DONE:
At some point I could add that the completed date of the goal is also displayed
All the goal names are capitalized before being added to the list.
Display completed goals in a table
