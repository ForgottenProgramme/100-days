# A Rough Documentation for starters
 
Now the app allows for deleting the goal file itself using the `delete-file` command for cases when the goal file has become corrupted for whatever reason

TODO:
Could add the same for "completed.txt" file.

Display completed goals in a table

Future: At some point I could add that the completed date of the goal is also displayed

All the goal names are capitalized before being added to the list.

ASK: Should "goals" be referenced as "goalz" at all places? That could be cool!

Wonder: Maybe I should have a journal.md file in every project so that I am able to brain dump my ideas and use them later! YES!

Before showing the project to Travis, add improved readme, gif etc

TODO:
print errors/warnings in different color for visibility.
