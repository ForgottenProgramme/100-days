# Goalz

A VERY simple CLI tool written in Python to track your "100 Days" goals. 

Make a new goal and stick to it for 100 days! 

Add a new goal to your goals list using:

```goalz add <goal_name>```

Update this goal by running:

```goalz update <goal_name>```

Each time you run the above command your goal is updated by 1%. 

Once you complete a goal 100%, it is moved to the "completed goals" file. You can see the list of your completed goals by running:

```goalz show-completed```
